      <h1>Meltem Kilic => Junior Web Developer / Engineer</h1>
      <p>
        Hi there! I'm Meltem. Before engaging in Web Development, I completed an extensive Engineering
        education including Chemical Engineering / Materials Science double major Bachelor of Science
        followed by an Engineering Master of Science degree. Along with my master's, I worked as a
        research assistant and conducted a research project on the utilization of Carbon Materials in
        Aluminum Production. I have currently rolled my sleeves up to learn basics of programming,
        Front End and Back End Web Development. My favorite activity other than learning programming
        is nerding out with other developers in tech meetups.
